# DEPRECATED

## Stylesheets is a community-generated collection of the best CSS resources.

## It was created to give the web design community a place to share and catalog all the best tools, tutorials, snippets, and repos you can find.
You can post anything that's CSS-related and let the community “star” something to let others know they found it useful, and also add it to their personal collection of starred posts. By default, posts are sorted showing the newest ones first, but you can also sort by number of stars and alphabetically.

For those interested in some of the my other work, be sure to check out [jamiewilson.io](http://jamiewilson.io">jamiewilson.io). You can also find me on [GitHub](http://github.com/jamiewilson), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jmwlsn), and [email](mailto:jamie@stylesheets).

## Special thanks to [ScreenshotMachine](http://screenshotmachine.com)
I'd like to thank <a href="http://screenshotmachine.com" target="_blank">ScreenshotMachine</a> for generously donating their screenshot generation service. Their service is really quick, easy and reliable. If you're in the market for a service for generating screenshots, then definitely give [ScreenshotMachine](http://screenshotmachine.com) a try.
